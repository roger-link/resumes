<h1><b>Engineer, Artist, and Beekeeper</b></h1>

<i>
Artistic Engineer looking for fun technical projects to work on. I'm particularly interested in working on projects related to the web and/or anything helping me to be more creative. I love programming in Python and hacking on hardware such as the Arduino/RaspberryPi. I work professionally on a large and complex Django application and would love the chance to work on smaller more creative web projects including artist portfolios and gallery installations.
